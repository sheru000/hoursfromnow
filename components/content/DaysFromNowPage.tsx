              Short-term planning typically involves dates from one week to one month ahead. Knowing what date is 7 days from now helps with weekly planning, 14 days from now works for bi-weekly schedules, and 30 days from now supports monthly planning cycles. These near-term dates are perfect for immediate project phases, upcoming appointments, short-term goals, and regular recurring events that require precise scheduling within the current planning window.

              Effective planning often requires working backwards from a fixed deadline.
