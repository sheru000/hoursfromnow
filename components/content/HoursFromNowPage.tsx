      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full-time: 2,080 hours annually (40 hours/week × 52 weeks) = $52,000/year at $25/hour</li>
        <li>Part-time varies based on how many hours is part time in your role</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="font-bold">Project Management:</h4>
      <p>
        Project managers use future time calculator features to set sprint deadlines, coordinate
        deliverables, and manage time in future milestones. The Project Management Institute
