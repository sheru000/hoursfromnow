        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A standard full-time work year typically involves 2,080 work hours (40 hours/week × 52 weeks). This calculation excludes holidays and vacation time. Understanding annual work hours helps with salary negotiations, hourly rate calculations, and employment contract discussions.
